The next LTS, which is currently targeted for the latter half of 2021, will make Polymer optional for HTML templates. Using LitElement for template-based views allows faster rendering of your app views. We aim to eventually make the Polymer dependency completely optional (opt-in), which will result in smaller bundle sizes and a lower network footprint for Vaadin applications. The timing of this depends on when we complete the component set transition to LitElement - we will keep you posted. In any event, Polymer support continue in the next LTS.\n<br>","title":"Future of HTML templates in Vaadin","draft":"false","imageUrl":"https:\/\/website.vaadin.com\/hubfs\/MarCom\/Templates-3.png","linkUrl":"https:\/\/vaadin.com\/blog\/future-of-html-templates-in-vaadin","iconUrl":"https:\/\/vaadin.com\/documents\/10187\/10395\/tori-icon-blue-bg-90px\/4597dffb-3868-4711-b422-8fc3e71844e6?t=1394217295000","id":"83678","validTo":"2020-09-26T00:00:00Z"}]}
